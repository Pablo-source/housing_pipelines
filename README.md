# housing pipelines - learning RAP and how to build R packages 
Practising content from Bruno Rodrigues book "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R"

Learning Git commands: 

Started to use Git from terminal to track all changes to several R scripts in a project
- git status
- git add .
- git commmit -m
- git pull
- git push -u origin master

Then using the terminal also from my Linux machine, push a local Git repository to a brand new GitHub project or repository. The following initial four scripts tracked in Git will be uploaded to this new GitHub repository:

Adding all changes to the above two R scripts from the terminal, learning all required commands to push and modify my scripts from the project folder using the terminal:

![03 git commit](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/a9055639-2cf0-4393-a902-9d5f838d353b)

Added new files to the project commit them to start tracking its changes on my local git repo. Uploading them to GitHub after several commits.

Initial set of changes have been pushed to GitHub from my local repo
