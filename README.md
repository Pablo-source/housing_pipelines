# housing pipelines - learning RAP and how to build R packages 
Practising content from Bruno Rodrigues book "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R"

Learning Git commands: 

Started to use Git from terminal to track all changes to several R scripts in a project
- git init
- git status
- git add .
- git commmit -m
- git pull
- git push -u origin master

Then using the terminal also from my Linux machine, push a local Git repository to a brand new GitHub project or repository. The following initial four scripts tracked in Git will be uploaded to this new GitHub repository:

![05 long list files in Housing folder](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/09137d13-c113-49c9-8272-dc933802ec29)

Untracked files modified using git in the steps described below:

![02 Git status example](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/dae534cc-d088-42b3-ac2a-54e663de5ea7)

## 1. Applying changes to code from git and uploading scrupt to GitHub

Adding all changes to the above R scripts from the terminal, learning all required commands to push and modify my scripts from the project folder using the terminal:

![03 git commit](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/a9055639-2cf0-4393-a902-9d5f838d353b)

Added new files to the project commit them to start tracking its changes on my local git repo. Uploading them to GitHub after several commits.

![04 git push example](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/6ce16bd2-2e1f-46b6-b549-ea2fcb36fb31)

Initial set of changes have been pushed to GitHub from my local repo

![01 git add commit and push full example](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/4a0f9fcc-a606-4197-8c8b-b24525990e0d)

## 2. Creating different branches to work on different features

For each new feature I create a new branches as from Pablo-tester from Pablo-source Master branch

![05 Create new branch to develop feature](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/e940ee49-7e7a-40c9-b333-9495e30295d3)

Then I request a pull request to include the finished features back into the master branch

![06 Pull request to incorporate an issue back to master](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/e030f74b-7396-47bc-9e8e-1aa271df5594)
![07 Pull reqeust closed and merged](https://github.com/Pablo-source/housing_pipelines/assets/76554081/daa9c316-8ab8-4a09-bf32-105abfd56632)
