Practising content from Bruno Rodrigues book "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R"

Learning Git commands: 

Started to use Git from terminal to track all changes to several R scripts in a project
- git status
- git add .
- git commmit -m
- git pull
- git push -u origin master

Then using the terminal also from my Linux machine, push a local Git repository to a brand new GitHub project or repository. The following two scripts tracked in Git will be uploaded to this new GitHub repository:

Adding all changes to the above two R scripts from the terminal, learning all required commands to push and modify my scripts from the project folder using the terminal:

Added new files to the project commit them to start tracking its changes on my local git repo. Uploading them to GitHub after several commits.
